# Notes on Cybersecurity

## Best Practices in defending Computer systems

### 1. Defense in depth approach

In Cybersecurity you need to reference to many sources. The main sources are:
- Frameworks -> a set of agreed upon policies, procedures and processes that define how information is managed (ex NIST)
- Best Practices -> procedures and processes that are widely accepted within an industry as being effective
- Vendor documentation -> a mix of requirements and suggestions for the specific security configuration of their product (ex Microsoft Server Security Guide)
- Regulatory Requirements -> laws that you must comply with

Defense in Depth is a concept that come from military terminology. It means to put many obstocles in front of the enemy and this way of thinking permits to minimize risks. 
So for Cybersecurity **Defense in Depth** means creating several components to protect my organization. The main components are prevention, detection and response.

The reference's framework in Cybersecurity is NIST. NIST is the National Institute of Standards and Technology.
