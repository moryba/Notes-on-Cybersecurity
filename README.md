# Notes on Cybersecurity

## Best Practices in defending Computer systems

### 1. Defense in depth approach

In Cybersecurity you need to reference to many sources. The main sources are:
- Frameworks -> a set of agreed upon policies, procedures and processes that define how information is managed (ex NIST)
- Best Practices -> procedures and processes that are widely accepted within an industry as being effective
- Vendor documentation -> a mix of requirements and suggestions for the specific security configuration of their product (ex Microsoft Server Security Guide)
- Regulatory Requirements -> laws that you must comply with

Defense in Depth is a concept that come from military terminology. It means to put many obstocles in front of the enemy and this way of thinking permits to minimize risks. 
So for Cybersecurity **Defense in Depth** means creating several components to protect my organization. The main components are prevention, detection and response.

The reference's framework in Cybersecurity is (NIST)[https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/sp800]. NIST is the National Institute of Standards and Technology. NISTs standards are a guide to help you to set up the various components of your security program. There are many NISTs standards to apply in cyber. Below some important standrds to remember:
- (NIST 800-41r1)[https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-41r1.pdf] -> it includes info about firewall types and technologies. It  provides network design examples and recommendations via high level network layouts. 
- (NIST 800-123)[https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-123.pdf] -> it contains valuable info about server vulnerabilities and threats
- (NIST 800-175Br1)[https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-175Br1.pdf] -> It is useful if your organization wants to implement encryption
- NIST CSF -> it provides info on authentication and identity management strategies, risk assessments, managing security in the supply chain and vulnerability disclosure.
